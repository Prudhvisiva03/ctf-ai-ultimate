# 🎯 About CTF-AI Ultimate

## The Problem

As a CTF player, you've probably experienced this:

1. **Download a challenge file**
2. **Run `file` command** - "PNG image"
3. **Google:** "how to find hidden data in PNG"
4. **Try 5 different tools** - zsteg, binwalk, steghide, exiftool...
5. **Still no flag** - Ask ChatGPT for help
6. **Repeat for EVERY challenge** 😫
