# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Misusing the tool for unauthorized access to systems
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Cybersecurity Ethics

As a cybersecurity tool, we hold ourselves to additional standards:

* **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities privately before public disclosure
* **Authorized Testing Only**: Only use this tool on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
* **Educational Intent**: Share knowledge to improve security, not to cause harm
* **Legal Compliance**: Follow all applicable laws and regulations

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
